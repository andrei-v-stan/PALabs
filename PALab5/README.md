Lucrat in plus (optional) :

- Represent the commands using classes instead of methods. Use an interface or an abstract class in order to desribe a generic command;
- Implement the commands add, list, save, load, play (create the classes AddCommand, ListCommand, etc.);
- The application will signal the commands that are not valid using a custom exception;
- Plus other trys here and there.
